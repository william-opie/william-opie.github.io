I've been using Jekyll Admin as the CMS for this blog since I first created it. It seemed like the easiest CMS to use out-of-the-box with Jekyll, and it worked well enough. A few months ago though, Jekyll Admin stopped being able to save posts properly (I suspect [this DependaBot PR](https://github.com/william-opie/william-opie.github.io/pull/4) was the culprit). I started getting various errors related to the rack gem (similar to what's described in [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77917512/whats-the-problem-with-ruby-jekyll-and-rack-handler)). I tried the suggested workaround of adding the rackup gem to my Gemfile. This resolved some of my errors, but others still remained. A missing method error would appear when I attempted to save new posts from Jekyll Admin. Rather than continuing to waste my time troubleshooting issues for a CMS that seems to be abandoned (based on the project's [commit history](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin)), I decided to check out other options.

ChatGPT led me to check out [Prose.io](https://prose.io/#about) and [Tina.io](https://tina.io/docs/). Prose looked OK, but Tina seemed to have a more modern interface. The [Jekyll setup guide](https://tina.io/docs/frameworks/jekyll/) also looked fairly straightforward. I got started setting up Tina for my blog and quickly found that the setup instructions were lacking details on how to setup the config file for Tina (there are some [example config files](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/main/examples/kitchen-sink/tina/config.tsx) in their Github repo, but none of them appear to be specific to Jekyll). Thankfully, I found [this blog post](https://dev.to/huwfulcher/how-to-integrate-tinacms-with-jekyll-1m6j) and managed to get [my config file](https://github.com/william-opie/william-opie.github.io/blob/main/tina/config.ts) in a "good enough" state for now. I can create new posts from the CMS locally, and the interface is pretty nice. Tina has a [cloud](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/overview/) and [self-hosted ](https://tina.io/docs/self-hosted/overview/)option, which might be worth exploring sometime down the road. For now, I'm just happy to have a functioning local CMS again.
